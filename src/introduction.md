# Intro to Machine Learning

This place will document my journey in creating a Machine Learning program using the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) entirely in Rust.
This is not intended to serve as an introductory resource for individuals seeking to learn ML. Instead, it is a personal resource for myself.
This will not go deeply into ML concepts.
If you wish to learn more, please refer to the resources listed at the bottom of the page.

All of the code can be found in [my repository](https://github.com/natoxpy/intro-to-ml-mnist.git).
